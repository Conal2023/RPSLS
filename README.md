## Testing

- I have tested this web page on three different browsers and works on all: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
- Device toolbar was also used to see the website through different screen sizes. 
- All buttons on the page were tested and confirmed to be working as they should. 
- Confirmed the correct results were given for all options. 


## Bugs

- When I first tried to create the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game my first try at coding didnt work. It kept giving wrong answers for Lizard and Spock. After multiple tries at fixing this I got extremely frustrated and ended up deleting both the work space on Codeanywhere and the Repo on Github. I continued to search for way to do it and after a good while looking found a solution. I was so close with the original code I now wish I didnt delete it. A lesson learnt for future projects.
