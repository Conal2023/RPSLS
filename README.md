## Testing

- I have tested this web page on three different browsers and works on all: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
- Device toolbar was also used to see the website through different screen sizes. 
- All buttons on the page were tested and confirmed to be working as they should. 
- Confirmed the correct results were given for all options. 


## Bugs

- When I first tried to create the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game my first try at coding didnt work. It kept giving wrong answers for Lizard and Spock. After multiple tries at fixing this I got extremely frustrated and ended up deleting both the work space on Codeanywhere and the Repo on Github. I continued to search for way to do it and after a good while looking found a solution. I was so close with the original code I now wish I didnt delete it. A lesson learnt for future projects. 

- When it came to testing at the end of the project I noticed I made a mistake with the Rules section. I had manually typed the numbers for the list when I should have coded this. From here I noticed when I went to fix this it caused issues with other areas in the project. Once i had all this fixed I then tried to test the page again and noticed that the bottom part of the list was now hidden behind the Footer. I tried multiple options but with no success so I turned to Google and found a solution which helped. 


## Validator Testing

## Credits 

- The Code Institute Love Running Project / Love Math Project had an impact on this project. There may be some similarities in the code but I tried to stray away as much as possible. 
- The W3Schools.com website helped a lot when I was struggling to find a way to do something. 
- Slack chats - I found some of the other students to be a great help with solutions to problems I was having or suggesting changes to the project.
